                90% market share in India prior to a nationwide ban by the Food
                Safety and Standards Authority of India. The ban was later
                lifted, but market share diminished to 53%.[8] In Malaysia and

                meaning they are specifically formulated to serve vegetarians.
                However, Maggi chicken noodles carry a red triangle, indicating
                that they are not vegetarian.[11] This special formulation is
                not available in other countries, unless imported from India. In
                the Philippines, localized versions of Maggi instant noodles
                were sold until 2011 when the product group was recalled for
                suspected Salmonella contamination.[12][13] It did not return to
                market, while Nestle continues to sell seasoning products
                including the popular Maggi Magic Sarap. Recipe mixes Recipe

                Vada Pav is a savory and spicy soft dinner rolls or fluffy buns,
                referred to as Pav, stuffed with a fried batter coated potato
                dumpling fritter called Batata Vada and laced with spicy and
                sweet chutneys. It is a popular vegan street food snack eaten in
                Mumbai and rest of the Maharashtra state in Western India. This
                dish is filling, delish, full of flavors and has various
                textures! Vada Pav is sold in shops, outside of schools and
                colleges all over Mumbai because it is so popular and loved by
                street food lovers. It is one of the most humble street foods in
                Mumbai, yet it is tasty and delicious. Vada pav basically has
                Batata Vada which is sandwiched between two slices of a pav
                (fluffy dinner roll) topped with sweet chutney, green chutney,
                and dry garlic chutney. Batata vada are fried batter coated
                potato dumpling fritters. The batter is made with nutty gram
                flour (besan) and spices. The filling consist of savory, spiced
                mashed potatoes. Batata means potato in Marathi language. While
                the term vada mostly means a fried fritter or a fried
                dumpling-like savory dish. Throughout my childhood, I ate vada
                pav in many places in Mumbai and it was always so delicious!
                Even today I still make sure that I buy vada pav whenever I
                visit Mumbai. However, when I am craving vada pav and can’t get
                to Mumbai, so I make them at home. Pav means a small loaf or bun
                of bread in Indian and is the same as dinner rolls. They are
                made with all purpose flour or whole wheat flour and can be
                bought from bakeries, super stores and sweet shops in India.
                Vada pav can be eaten during any time of the day like breakfast,
                brunch, or in the evening as a snack. It goes very well with
                Indian chai, fried green chilies, and chutney like coriander
                chutney or mint chutney or green chutney or any chutney of your
                choice. To make vada pav you need five elements: Pav – Fluffy
                dinner rolls or buns. Get the Pav Recipe here or buy from your
                favorite bakery. Batata vada – Fried potato stuffed fritter. I
                share detailed recipe below. Green Chutney – A piquant and spicy
                condiment made with coriander (cilantro) or mint and coriander
                leaves. Tamarind Chutney – This is a sweet and tangy chutney
                made with tamarind, jaggery and spices. Garlic Chutney – A spicy
                dry chutney made with garlic cloves and coconut.

                Pav bhaji (Marathi : पाव भाजी) is a street food dish from India
                consisting of a thick vegetable curry (bhaji) served with a soft
                bread roll (pav). It originated in the city of Mumbai. The dish
                originated as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in
                Mumbai. Pav bhaji was later served at restaurants throughout the
                city.[4][5] Pav bhaji is now offered at outlets from simple hand
                carts to formal restaurants in India and abroad Pav bhaji is a
                spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy served with
                bread. Vegetables in the curry may commonly include potatoes,
                onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes.
                Street sellers usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava)
                and serve the dish hot. A soft white bread roll is the usual
                accompaniment to the curry, but this does not preclude the use
                of other bread varieties such as chapati, roti or brown bread.

                the pav tossed in the bhaji Paneer pav bhaji, with paneer cheese
                in the bhaji Mushroom pav bhaji, with mushrooms in the bhaji
                Khada pav bhaji, in which vegetables are in chunks rather than
                mashed Jain pav bhaji, without onions and garlic[8] and with
                plantains instead of potatoes[9] Kolhapuri pav bhaji, using a
                spice mix common in Kolhapur
